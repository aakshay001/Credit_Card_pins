  EXPLANATORY NOTE

  The Legacy Place Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 9.3% of the
  asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, is an asset of the
  issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Legacy
  Place Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of
  the issuing entity. The Americold Cold Storage Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which
  constituted approximately 8.2% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of
  its cut-off date, is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan
  combination that includes the Americold Cold Storage Portfolio Mortgage Loan
  and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity.
  These two loan combinations, including, respectively, the Legacy Place
  Mortgage Loan and the Americold Cold Storage Portfolio Mortgage Loan, are
  being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
  Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual
  Report on Form 10-K.

  The Exhibit Index describes Exhibits provided by certain parties (in their
  capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the IDS Center
  Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 6.7% of the asset pool of the
  issuing entity as of its cut-off date.  The IDS Center Mortgage Loan is an
  asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes
  the IDS Center Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan that is not an
  asset of the issuing entity.  This loan combination, including the IDS
  Center Mortgage Loan, was serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
  for the issuing entity prior to the closing of the securitization of the
  other pari passu portion of the IDS Center loan combination in the J.P.
  Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-C13 transaction,
  Commission File Number 333-165147-09 (the "JPMCC 2013-C13 Transaction"). After
  the closing of the JPMCC 2013-C13 Transaction on July 17, 2013, this loan
  combination, including the IDS Center Mortgage Loan was, and will continue to
  be, serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement
  with respect to the JPMCC 2013-C13 Transaction, which is incorporated by
  reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  The Exhibit Index describes Exhibits provided by certain parties (in their
  capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the Southridge
  Mall Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 3.7% of the asset pool
  of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date.  The Southridge Mall Mortgage
  Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination
  that includes the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu
  loan that is not an asset of the issuing entity.  This loan combination,
  including the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan, was serviced under the Pooling
  and Servicing Agreement for the issuing entity prior to the closing of the
  securitization of the other pari passu portion of the Southridge Mall loan
  combination in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-C14
  transaction, Commission File Number 333-165147-10 (the "JPMBB 2013-C14
  Transaction"). After the closing of the JPMBB 2013-C14 Transaction on August
  19, 2013, this loan combination, including the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan
  was, and will continue to be, serviced and administered pursuant to the
  pooling and servicing agreement with respect to the JPMBB 2013-C14
  Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.3 to this Annual
  Report on Form 10-K.

  Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC ("Berkadia") acted as special servicer
  under the pooling and servicing agreement for the JPMCC 2013-C13 Transaction
  prior to September 6, 2013, the date on which it assigned its rights and
  duties as special servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to
  KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc.

  With respect to the IDS Center Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately
  6.7% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, Berkadia
  was the special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the
  JPMCC 2013-C13 Transaction prior to September 6, 2013, the date as of which it
  assigned its rights and duties as special servicer under such pooling and
  servicing agreement to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. In accordance
  with the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations, Section
  17.02, Berkadia's servicing percentage must be reduced pro rata to reflect
  that Berkadia was participating in a servicing function with respect to the
  asset pool of the issuing entity only from July 17, 2013 to September 5, 2013.
  As a result, Berkadia falls below the de minimis requirements in Items 1122
  and 1123 of Regulation AB and no assessment of compliance with applicable
  servicing criteria, accountant's attestation report on assessment of
  compliance with applicable servicing criteria or annual compliance statement
  is required.

  Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association
  ("Midland") is the master servicer for the mortgage loans serviced under the
  Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the primary servicer for the IDS Center
  Mortgage Loan and the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan and, on and after August
  19, 2013, the special servicer for the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan. These
  mortgage loans, in the aggregate, constituted more than 10% of the asset pool
  of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. Thus, Midland is a "servicer,"
  as defined in Item 1108(a)(iii) of Regulation AB, with respect to these
  mortgage loans. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing
  criteria, accountants' attestation reports and servicer compliance statements
  delivered by Midland in the capacities described above are listed in the
  Exhibit Index.

  KeyBank National Association (as successor to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
  Markets, Inc.) ("KeyBank") acted as sub-special servicer for the IDS Center
  Mortgage Loan under the pooling and servicing agreement for the JPMCC 2013-C13
  Transaction from August 1, 2013 to and including September 5, 2013, and
  assumed the obligations of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC as special
  servicer for the IDS Center Mortgage Loan under the pooling and servicing
  agreement for the JPMCC 2013-C13 Transaction as of September 6, 2013. The IDS
  Center Mortgage Loan constituted approximately 6.7% of the asset pool of the
  issuing entity as of its cut-off date. In addition, KeyBank is the primary
  servicer, under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, for the Colony Hills
  Portfolio Loans - Yester Oaks Apartments, Colony Hills Portfolio Loans -
  Windsor Place and Pathways Apartments, Northway Center, Homewood Suites -
  Miami, Park 50, Bluerock Net Lease Portfolio, GSA Building - Jersey City, Keep
  It Self Storage, Walgreens - Bonner Springs, Marketplace of Americus, and
  Walgreens  Waynesboro Mortgage Loans, which collectively constituted
  approximately 9.3% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off
  date. Thus, KeyBank is a "servicer," as defined in Item 1108(a)(iii) of
  Regulation AB, with respect to the mortgage loans identified in this paragraph
  because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 10% or more of the
  assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of
  compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants' attestation
  reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by KeyBank in the
  capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index.

  Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo Bank") is the
  certificate administrator for the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling
  and Servicing Agreement and the certificate administrator for the IDS Center
  Mortgage Loan and the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan. These mortgage loans,
  in the aggregate, constituted more than 10% of the asset pool of the issuing
  entity as of its cut-off date. Thus, Wells Fargo Bank, in the capacities
  described above, is a "servicer," as defined in Item 1108(a)(iii) of
  Regulation AB, with respect to these mortgage loans. The assessments of
  compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants' attestation
  reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Wells Fargo in these
  capacities are listed in the Exhibit Index.

  Wells Fargo Bank is the trustee and custodian for the mortgage loans
  serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the trustee and
  custodian for the IDS Center Mortgage Loan and the Southridge Mall Mortgage
  Loan. These mortgage loans, in the aggregate, constituted more than 5% of
  the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. Thus, Wells
  Fargo Bank in the capacities described above is a servicing function
  participant with respect to these mortgage loans. The assessments of
  compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants' attestation
  reports delivered by Wells Fargo in these capacities are listed in the
  Exhibit Index.

  Pentalpha Surveillance LLC ("Pentalpha") is the senior trust advisor for the
  mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the
  senior trust advisor for the IDS Center Mortgage Loan and the Southridge
  Mall Mortgage Loan. These mortgage loans, in the aggregate, constituted more
  than 5% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. Thus,
  Pentalpha is a servicing function participant with respect to these
  mortgage loans. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing
  criteria and accountants' attestation reports delivered by Pentalpha in the
  capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index.

compliance with respect to the Southridge Mall Mortgage Loan, which is being
serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for
the JPMBB 2013-C14 Transaction, are attached as Exhibits 33.15, 33.16, 33.21,

The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2013, furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB
by KeyBank National Association (the "2013 KeyBank Assessment") for its
commercial real estate mortgage loans platform, discloses that material
instances of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criteria
described in Items 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(x)(c) of Regulation AB. The 2013
KeyBank Assessment is attached to this Form 10-K as Exhibit 33.1. The material
instances of noncompliance disclosed in the 2013 KeyBank Assessment are as
follows:

1) KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank") has identified the following
material instances of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and
1122(d)(4)(x)(c)applicable to the commercial loans securitized during the year
ended December 31, 2013, as follows:

i) 1122(d)(4)(i) Collateral or security on pool assets is maintained as
required by the transaction agreements or related pool asset documents.

ii) 1122(d)(4)(x)(c)-Regarding any funds held in trust for an obligor (such as
escrow accounts): such funds are returned to the obligor within 30 calendar days
of full repayment of the related pool asset, or such other number of days
specified in the transaction agreements.

2) KeyBank has implemented the following remediation procedures:

i) 1122(d)(4)(i)- Regarding UCC filings, it was discovered, upon transfer of the
servicing to KeyBank from the previous servicer, that two loans did not have
appropriate UCC filings originally filed or continued. The loans have since been
corrected, and KeyBank determined that no liens were filed in front of the UCC
filing. All loans, for which servicing was transferred to KeyBank during 2013,
have been reviewed, and, the filings are being maintained in accordance
with the transaction agreements.

ii) 1122(d)(4)(x)(c)- Escrow funds were not returned to the obligor within 30
calendar days of repayment. Appropriate steps have been taken, including monthly
status meetings, meeting minutes, and revised procedures to insure that the
refund of escrows occurs within 30 calendar days of full repayment.

MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION ON
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB CRITERIA

KeyBank National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate
Capital Markets, Inc (the "Asserting Party") is responsible for assessing
compliance for the transactions listed on Attachment A for the period January
1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 (the "Reporting Period"), with the servicing
criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal
Regulations (the "CFR"), except for the servicing criteria set forth in
Sections 229.1122(d)(3)(i) - (iv) which the Asserting Party has concluded are
not applicable to the servicing of the transactions listed on Attachment A,
backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting
Party (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"). Although the Asserting Party is
responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122 (d)(1)(iii) of
Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Asserting
Party during the year ended December 31, 2013 that required this servicing
criteria to be complied with.

The Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party
has complied, in all material respects, except as discussed in Attachment B,
with the applicable servicing criteria for the transactions listed on
Attachment A backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans serviced by the
Asserting Party.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

KeyBank National Association
Management's Assertion of Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria
For the Period of January 1 through December 31, 2013

Attachment B*

1) Key Bank National Association (Key) has identified the following
   material instances of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and
   1122(d)(4)(x)(c) applicable to the commercial loans securitized during the
   year ended December 31, 2013, as follows:

i) 1122(d)(4)(i) -Collateral or security on pool assets is maintained as
   required by the transaction agreements or related pool asset documents.

ii) 1122(d)(4)(x)(c)-Regarding any funds held in trust for an obligor (such
    as escrow accounts): Such funds are returned to the obligor within 30
    calendar days of full repayment of the related pool asset, or such other
    number of days specified in the transaction agreements.

2) Key has implemented the following remediation procedures:

i) 1122(d)(4)(i)-Regarding UCC filings, it was discovered, upon transfer of
   the servicing to Key from the previous servicer, that two loans did not
   have appropriate UCC filings originally filed or continued. The loans
   have since been corrected, and Key determined that no liens were filed
   in front of the UCC filing. All loans, for which servicing was
   transferred to Key during 2013, have been reviewed, and, the filings are
   being maintained in accordance with the transaction agreements.

ii) 1122(d)(4)(x)(c)-Escrow funds were not returned to the obligor within
    30 calendar days of repayment. Appropriate steps have been taken,
    including monthly status meetings, meeting minutes, and revised
    procedures to insure that the refund of escrows occurs within 30
    calendar days of full repayment.

1. LNR Partners, LLC. (the "Asserting Party") is responsible for assessing
   compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d)
   of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as of and for the 12-month period ending

2. The Asserting Party has engaged certain vendors, which are not servicers as
   defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB (the "Vendors"), to perform
   specific, limited or scripted activities, and the Asserting Party elects to
   take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria or
   portion of the servicing criteria applicable to such Vendors' activities as
   set forth in Appendix A hereto;

3. Except as set forth in paragraph 4 below, the Asserting Party used the
   criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB to assess
   the compliance with the applicable servicing criteria;

4. The criteria listed in the column titled "Inapplicable Servicing Criteria"
   on Appendix A hereto are inapplicable to the Asserting Party based on the
   activities it performs, directly or through its Vendors, with respect to the
   Platform;

5. The Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the
   applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2013 and for the Reporting
   Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole;

6. The Asserting Party has not identified and is not aware of any material
   instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing
   criteria as of December 31, 2013 and for the Reporting Period with respect
   to the Platform taken as a whole;

7. The Asserting Party has not identified any material deficiency in its
   policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the
   applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2013 and for the Reporting
   Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole; and

8. Deloitte & Touche LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an
   attestation report on the Asserting Party's assessment of compliance with
   the applicable servicing criteria for the Reporting Period.

Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria

Midland Loan Services ("Midland"), a division of PNC Bank, National Association,
is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122 (d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("Regulation AB"), as set forth in Appendix A hereto, relating to its
role in the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions.

Midland has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the "Reporting Period"). In making
this assessment, Midland used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB. This report covers
the commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions (the "Platform").

Midland engaged certain vendors, which are not servicers as defined in item
1101(j) of Regulation AB (the "Vendors"), to perform specific, limited or
scripted activities related to portions of the servicing criteria as set forth
in Appendix A. Midland elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria or portion of the servicing criteria applicable to
such Vendors' activities as set forth in Appendix A. Midland has not identified
and is not aware of any material instances of noncompliance by the Vendors with
the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2013 and for the Reporting
Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole, nor has it identified any
material deficiencies in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance
by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2013
and for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.

Based on this assessment, Midland believes that, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013, Midland has complied in all material respects with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB relating to its
role in the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
has issued an attestation report on Midland's assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Management's Report on Assessment of 2013 Compliance by Pentalpha
Surveillance, LLC With Regulation AB Servicing Criteria


Pentalpha Surveillance, LLC (the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing
its compliance, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations.

The assessment concerns the Asserting Party's servicing efforts for its
servicing "Platform," which consists of its servicing activities encompassed by
contractual obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (see the Exhibit for
a list of the Asserting Party's Platform of required reporting by the servicing
agreements).

The Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Asserting Party
used the criteria in Paragraph (d) of Section 1122 of Regulation AB
(17 C.F.R. 229.1122) to assess its compliance.

Based on such assessment, the Asserting Party believes that as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2013, the Asserting Party has complied in all material
respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB
relating to its operational advisor role in the servicing of the Platform,
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i-iv), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii),
1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi) and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv), which the Asserting
Party has determined as being inapplicable to the activities it performs with
respect to the Platform being serviced (the "applicable servicing criteria").

McGladrey LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria for the reporting period as set forth in this assertion.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA


The management ("Management") of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Company") is responsible for assessing
the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards
to the servicing platform for the period as follows:

Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 (the "Period").

Platform: The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed securities
("CMBS") transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration and/or paying agent services and where some or all of the
offered securities for such CMBS transactions were either (a) publicly-issued
pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of
1933, or (b) privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from registration where
the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions (i) where the offered securities were issued, sponsored or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government sponsored entity, and (ii) where the offered securities were issued
pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which
the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined by
Regulation AB) (the "CMBS Platform"). Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the CMBS Platform for the
Period.

Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d), to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, in
regards to the activities performed by the Company, except for the following
servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix),
1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and
1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the
activities the Company performed with respect to the CMBS Platform for the
Period (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria").

Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform
Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criterion.
Management has determined that this vendor is not considered a "servicer" as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that
the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the
vendor and related criterion.

With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management provides the
following assessment of the Company's compliance with respect to the Applicable
Servicing Criteria:

1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company's compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria.

2. Management has assessed the Company's compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion for which compliance is
determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

3. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and
1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities.

4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied, in all
material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

attestation report with respect to Management's assessment of the Company's
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

The management ("Management") of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Company") is responsible for assessing
the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards
to the servicing platform for the period as follows:

Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 (the "Period").

Platform: The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities
("RMBS") transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans and
commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans, in each case for which the Company provides document
custody services and where the RMBS and CMBS transactions were either (a)
publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b) privately-issued pursuant to an
exemption from registration on or after January 1, 2006 where the Company has
an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions
where the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any
agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government sponsored
entity, other than certain securitizations of residential mortgage loan
transactions issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Company (the "Document Custody Platform"). Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period.

Applicable Servicing Criteria: Management has determined that the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the activities performed
by the Company with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period;
provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company's
obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"). Management has determined
that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable
to the Document Custody Platform.

With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period, Management
provides the following assessment of the Company's compliance with respect to
the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company's compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria.

2. Management has assessed the Company's compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB.

3. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii) and
1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody Platform,
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities.

4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied, in all
material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report with respect to Management's assessment of the Company's
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

(3) The transaction requires that Management assess to the Company's compliance
    with Item 1122(d)(1)(ii). Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) was inadvertently omitted
    from the applicable servicing criteria for the Revised 2012 Custody
    Assessment. Management has determined that there were no activities

    determined that it is not required to assess to the Company's compliance
    with Item 1122(d)(4)(iii). Therefore, such transaction should not have been
    indicated on such Appendix A as subject to Item 1122(d)(4)(iii).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholder
KeyBank National Association

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Management's Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria, that KeyBank
National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
Markets, Inc., (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the
commercial real estate mortgage loans platform (the Platform), except for the
instances of material noncompliance described therein, as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2013, and except for Item 1122 (d)(3)(i), 1122 (d)(3)(ii),
1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the Platform
covered by this report. Refer to Attachment A of management's assertion for the
asset backed transactions covered by this Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although
the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of
Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company
during the year ended December 31, 2013 that required these servicing criteria
to be complied with. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.

Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with servicing
criteria 1122 (d)(4)(i) and 1122 (d)(4)(x) applicable to the Company during the
year ended December 31, 2013. The noncompliance in 1122 (d)(4)(i) related to a
servicing portfolio acquired by the Company during the year where appropriate
security on pool assets was not maintained. The noncompliance in 1122 (d)(4)(x)
related to failure to return funds held in escrows to the obligor within 30
calendar days of full repayment of the related pool assets and was the result of
an ineffective control over the loan repayment process.

The information in Attachment B under the subheading (e.g., Remediation
Procedures) is presented by the Company for information purposes. Such
information has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our examination
of management's assertion as described above and accordingly, we express no
opinion on it.

In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the third
paragraph, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2013.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


LNR Partners, LLC
Miami Beach, Florida

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB
Servicing Criteria, that LNR Partners, LLC (the "Company") complied with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed securities
transactions for which the Company served as special servicer, and that were
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Platform") as of and for the year ended December
31, 2013, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(c), (3)(i)(d), (3)(ii),
(3)(iii), (3)(iv), (4)(v), (4)(ix), (4)(x), (4)(xi), (4)(xii), (4)(xiii),
(4)(xiv) and (4)(xv) which management has determined are not applicable to the
activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample
basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether
the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have
included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included
in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period
specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013 for the commercial mortgage-backed securities Platform is
fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors
The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:


We have examined the management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, that the
Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for commercial
mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") transactions backed by pools of commercial
mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee,
securities administration and/or paying agent services and where some or all of
the offered securities for such CMBS transactions were either (a)
publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the
Securities Act of 1933, or (b) privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from
registration where the Company has an obligation under the transaction
agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions (i) where the offered securities were
issued, sponsored or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government sponsored entity, and (ii) where the offered
securities were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January
1, 2006 and for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities
(as defined by Regulation AB) (the "CMBS Platform") to the extent required in
the related transaction agreements, in regards to the activities performed by
the Company, except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performed with
respect to the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31,
2013 (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"). With respect to applicable
servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2013 with respect to the Platform, because there were no
occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. Appendix A to the Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria identifies the individual transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment about the
Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS
Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the

period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions
or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.

As described in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance With the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, for servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has
engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing
criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a
"servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has
elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criterion
as described in management's Assessment of Compliance With the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2013 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors
The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:

We have examined the management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, that the
Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") transactions backed by pools of residential
mortgage loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") transactions
backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans, in each case for which the
Company provides document custody services and where the RMBS and CMBS
transactions were either (a) publicly-issued pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b)
privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from registration on or after January
1, 2006 where the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to
deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform
excludes any transactions where the offered securities were issued, sponsored
and/ or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or
any government sponsored entity, other than certain securitizations of
residential mortgage loan transactions issued, sponsored and/ or guaranteed by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "Document Custody Platform") as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the
activities performed by the Company with respect to the Document Custody
Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013; provided
however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company's
obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"), as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2013. Management has determined that all other
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Document
Custody Platform. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii)
and 1122(d)(4)(iii), management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the
individual transactions and securities defined by management as constituting
the Document Custody Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assessment about the Companys compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed

transactions and securities that comprise the Document Custody Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have
occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period

We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
